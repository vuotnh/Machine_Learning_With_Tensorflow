Machine Learning with TensorFlow, 2nd Edition
=============================================
<a href="https://www.manning.com/books/machine-learning-with-tensorflow-second-edition?a_aid=5700fc87&a_bid=1e05f0bb" alt="Machine Learning with TensorFlow 2nd Edition"><img src="figs/mltf2-cover.jpeg"/></a>

This is the code repository for the 2nd edition of [Manning Publications'](http://manning.com/)
[Machine Learning with TensorFlow](https://www.manning.com/books/machine-learning-with-tensorflow-second-edition?a_aid=5700fc87&a_bid=1e05f0bb) 
written by [Chris Mattmann](http://twitter.com/chrismattmann/).

The code in this repository is mostly [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) that correspond
to the numbered listings in each chapter of the book. The code has beeen tested with 
[TensorFlow 1.15.2](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.15/api_docs/python/tf) but there 
is a complete porting of the code in the book to [TensorFlow 2.x](https://github.com/chrismattmann/MLwithTensorFlow2ed/tree/master/TFv2).

We welcome contributions to the TF2 port and to all of the notebooks in TF1.15.x too!

## Quick Start

The repository contains two fully functional [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/chrismattmann/mltf2/tags?page=1&ordering=last_updated) images. The first `latest` runs with TF1.15.x and tracks with the book examples. You can get going by simply running from a command prompt:

```
$ docker pull chrismattmann/mltf2:latest
$ ./run_environment.sh
```

This will pull the TF1.15.x image and start Juptyer running on localhost. Watch for the startup 
message, and then click through (including the token needed past the `?` in the URL) to start
Your Juptyer session.

To run the TF2.x version of the code and notebooks you can similarly run the `tf2` tag:

```
$ docker pull chrismattmann/mltf2:tf2
$ ./run_TFv2_environment.sh
``` 

Follow the URL from the startup message.

Enjoy!

## Pre-requisites

Though the book has [TensorFlow](http://twitter.com/tensorflow) in the name, the book is also
just as machine about generalized machine learning and its theory, and the suite of frameworks
that also come in handy when dealing with machine learning. The requirements for running the 
notebooks are below. You should PIP install them using your favorite Python. The examples from
the book have been shown to work in Python 2.7, and Python 3.7. I didn't have time to test all 
of them but we are happy to receive PRs for things we've missed.

Additionally the [Docker](Dockerfile) has been tested and on latest Docker for Mac only adds
about 1.5% overhead on CPU mode and is totally usable and a one-shot easy installer for all of
the dependencies. Browse the file to see what  you'll need to install and how to run the 
code locally if desired.

 * TensorFlow 
 * Jupyter
 * Pandas - for data frames and easy tabular data manipulation
 * NumPy, SciPy
 * Matplotlib
 * [NLTK](http://nltk.org/) - for anything text or NLP (such as Sentiment Analysis from Chapter 6)
 * TQDM - for progress bars
 * SKLearn - for various helper functions
 * [Bregman Toolkit](https://github.com/bregmanstudio/BregmanToolkit/) (for audio examples in Chapter 7)
 * [Tika](http://github.com/chrismattmann/tika-python)
 * [Ystockquote](https://github.com/cgoldberg/ystockquote)
 * Requests
 * [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/)
 * [Horovod](https://github.com/horovod/horovod) - use 0.18.2 (or 0.18.1) for use with the Maverick2 VGG Face model.
 * [VGG16](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~frossard/post/vgg16/)  - grab `vgg16.py` and `vgg16_weights.npz`, `imagenet_classes.py` and `laska.png` - only works with Python2.7,  place
in the `lib` directory.
 * PyDub - for Chapter 17 in the LSTM chapter.
 * [Basic Units](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/master/examples/units/basic_units.py) - for use in Chapter 17. Place in `libs/basic_units/` folder.
 * [RNN-Tutorial](https://github.com/mrubash1/RNN-Tutorial/) - used in Chapter 17 to help implement the deep speech model and train it.

## Data Requirements

You will generate lots of data when running the notebooks in particular building models. But to train and
build those models you will also need data. I have created an easy [DropBox](http://dropbox.com/) folder
for you to pull input data for use in training models from the book. Access the DropBox folder 
[here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/abjqqcwuzx2mttd/AADIM01H44Y-tdAHXUHt5ZWFa?dl=0).

Note that the Docker build described below automatically pulls down all the data for you and incorporates it
into the Docker environment so that you don't have to download a thing.

The pointers below let you know what data you need for what chapters, and where to put it. Unless otherwise
not specified, the data should be placed into the `data` folder. Note that as you are running the notebooks
the notebooks will generate TF models and write them and `checkpoint` files to the `models/` folder.

## Setting up the environment (Tested on Mac and Linux)

### Using Docker

#### Building the image

```shell
# Only builds a Docker compatible with GPU and CPU.
./build_environment.sh #TensorFlow1
./build_TFv2_environment.sh #TensorFlow2
```

#### Running the notebook from docker

```shell
# Runs in GPU and CPU mode and will look for NVIDIA drivers first and fall back to reg CPU.
./run_environment.sh #TensorFlow1
./run_TFv2_environment.sh # TensorFlow2
```

#### Using a GPU

You need to install [nvidia-docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker) to use your
GPU in docker. Follow these instructions (also on the linked page)

```shell
# Add the package repositories
distribution=$(. /etc/os-release;echo $ID$VERSION_ID)
curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/gpgkey | sudo apt-key add -
curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/$distribution/nvidia-docker.list | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-docker.list

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-container-toolkit
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

### Using your local python

#### Building the environment

If you want to build with your existing Python that's fine
you  will need a Python2.7 for some of the chapters noted
above (like chapter7 which uses `BregmanToolkit`), and
python 3.7 for everything else. The requirements.txt file
is different for each, so watch while one to pip install
below.

```shell
#Python3.7 - GPU and CPU
$ pip3.7 install -r requirements.txt

#Python3.7 - TensorFlow2 GPU and CPU
$ pip3.7 install -r requirements-tf2.txt

#Python2.7 - CPU
$ pip2.7 install -r requirements-py2.txt

#Python2.7 - GPU
$ pip2.7 install -r requirements-gpu-py2.txt
```

#### Running the notebook from your local environment

```shell
$ jupyter notebook
```
